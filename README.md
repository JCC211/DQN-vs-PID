# DQN-vs-PID
A comparison of DQN control vs PID control for the gymnasium cart pole environment. The file PID_Cartpole.ipynb is used to build the DQN model and train to find a solution. The test.ipynb file is used to test the comparison of the DQN model vs the PID model. Ultimately the DQN model successfully completed 10/10 trials and the PID method 1/10 trials
